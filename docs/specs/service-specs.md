# Dusty Service Specs
These specs are used to specify services for you local environment. They should go in the services folder in your specs repo.

The service spec is actually just a direct copy of [Docker Compose's yml spec](https://docs.docker.com/compose/yml/).  All keys are just mapped directly into the Docker Compose yml.
